## My process
First, i built the layout of the page using HTML before building the CSS part of the project without the use of any frameworks.
I also added the hover states for each specified elements in the challenge.  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- media-queries

### What I learned

In this challenge, i strengthened my knowledge on flex-box and the different ways to apply it. I learnt more about absolute and relative positioning, hover states and many more.

### Continued development

In future, i would like to perfect centering of divs and usingg of flexboxes for styling.
